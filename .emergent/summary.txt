The AI engineer successfully built the Lakeside Indian Restaurant application, evolving from initial WordPress requirements to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. Development covered public-facing features, then an extensive admin panel for content management. Key accomplishments include implementing dynamic menus (dine-in/takeaway), gallery, testimonials, and particularly robust banner management with image uploads.

Recent efforts focused on refining image uploads for banners and gallery, addressing persistent display issues through backend routing adjustments and frontend cache-busting. Menu updates (takeaway, dine-in) via PDF extraction were completed. UI enhancements included footer credits, section background images, and making statistics editable via admin. The core recent feature involved a significant overhaul of header/footer navigation, centralizing ordering via a dedicated Order Online page, and adjusting cart/wishlist visibility. Domain connection issues were escalated to support. The current task involves linking the Continue Shopping button to the takeaway menu.

The user initially requested a Lakeside Indian Restaurant e-commerce website, pivoting from WordPress to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack application with a black/red, elegant theme. Key features included:
- **Frontend:** Home (carousel, about preview, stats, mini menu, gallery preview, forms, testimonials), About Us, Menu (grid/list, add to cart), Gallery (lightbox), Contact Us (form, map), Reservation (form), Cart, Wishlist.
- **Backend:** Admin panel for dynamic content management (menus, gallery, banners, forms, settings), admin authentication, email forms. Payment integration was deferred.
- **Enhancements:** Logo in header/footer, Menu split into Dine-in and Takeaway, dynamic home page banners with image upload, cart quantity controls, empty cart navigation to menu selection, no images in wishlist. Admin to manage contacts, reservations, menus, gallery, testimonials, banners. Footer to include Business Web Media credit. Background images for testimonials and statistics sections, editable statistics from admin. Recently, a major navigation overhaul was requested: consolidate ordering under an Order Online button in the header (leading to takeaway menu), remove cart/wishlist from main header, add them to Order Online and Cart/Wishlist pages, adjust Featured Dishes buttons, and update footer links.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major UI/navigation overhaul. The header and footer now reflect a new structure: an Order Online button in the main header (which leads to the takeaway menu) and Our Menu replacing Dine-in Menu. Cart and Wishlist icons are now dynamically displayed only on the Order Online (Takeaway), Cart, and Wishlist pages, and hidden from the main header on other pages. The Dine-in menu no longer has Add to Cart or wishlist options, serving purely as a browsing menu. The homepage's Featured Dishes buttons have been updated to View More and Order Online. The footer's Quick Links are split into two columns, and an Order Online link has been added.
The immediate next task, based on the last conversation, is to modify the Continue Shopping button on the Cart page.
