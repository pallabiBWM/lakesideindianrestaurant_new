The AI engineer successfully transformed initial requirements for a WordPress site into a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for Lakeside Indian Restaurant. Initially, the focus was on building the public-facing frontend with core features like menus, gallery, contact, reservations, cart, and wishlist, backed by a FastAPI API and MongoDB. After the initial build, the user requested an admin panel for content management, including dynamic menus, gallery, banners, and forms. The AI engineer has progressed significantly on this, implementing admin authentication, backend content APIs, and the frontend admin dashboard, including menu, gallery, and testimonial management. The most recent focus has been on refining frontend functionality like cart quantity controls and dynamic banner management with image uploads. The current task is to complete the image upload functionality for banners.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into a  (FastAPI, Python) and  (React, JavaScript) directory.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : The main FastAPI application. It has been significantly rewritten to include:
    *   MongoDB connection.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing **image upload functionality** for the home page banners within the admin panel. The user explicitly requested to have an image upload option not image link for banners.
So far, the following actions have been taken:
1.  The directory  was created to store uploaded images ().
2.  The  Python package was installed in the backend, which is typically used for asynchronous file operations, indicating preparation for file handling ().
The trajectory ends with the AI engineer stating, Let me continue by adding the file upload functionality to the backend (). This means the backend endpoint for handling image uploads and potentially associated model updates are the immediate next steps. The frontend forms for banner management would then need to be updated to utilize this new upload endpoint.
